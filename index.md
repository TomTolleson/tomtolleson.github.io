Repositories

Old Weather - This repository contains my pro bono work with NOAA's Old Weather Project which extracts and interprets oceanic and polar ice data from 19th-Century ship logs. For this project to produce data that can be dealt with by modern methods, the handwritten logs would either need to be keyed in manually by humans or converted from handwriting to alphanumberic text via machine learning. This repository contains the Python scripts, Postgres database and data pipleine structures in a portable, distributed Docker Swarm format. All technology used is free and open source.

Symmetry - A geo-tracking mobile app built using Apache Cordova. If social media companies are earning profits from our location data. why are we not brokering it to them and retrieving some of that profit for ourselves? It is our data and having a user's brookerage service acting as a seller's agent is no different than in real estate or other financial transactions.

Puckel Airflow - Just some work I've done to implement Redis Commander into an existing, distributed implementation of Apache Airflow using Celery as a message broker. Docker Swarm will be used to orchestrate manager/nodes.
