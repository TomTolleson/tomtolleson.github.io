<p>This is the website for me,Tom Tolleson, hosted in github with a brief bit of information about me. My repos are listed to the right which, if nothing else, shows my interests and things I've been tinkering with. 

Items you won't see here: I studied music composition at <a href="https://www.juilliard.edu/">The Juilliard School</a> and have composed music using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a> and an ide known as <a href="https://opusmodus.com/">OpusModus</a>.

I also founded and run a record label known as <a href="https://www.dymaxiongroove.com/">Dymaxion Groove</a>.

While the results are not in any repo, the results can be heard in my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/03QHVhwFbGvn44thWu1Sf4?si=Lo2_G4wcSCiIlTGXDdLBxw"> published music</a>.</p>


Senior engineering leader with 15+ years of planning, management, and data/infrastructure experience.

As an engineering director, I define and implement policies for security in vendor management as well as the software and data supply chain. Iâ€™m interested in protectingLLM and AI vulnerabilities, as well as the ever-increasing attack surface of software development. 

As a people manager, I lead transformation through automation as well as the recruitment of talent, which has an outsized impact on the trajectory of the company.

I achieve buy-in for initiatives by building relationships with internal and external stakeholders. I keep managers and staff strategically aligned to maximize impact while providing input on tactical processes. This allows me to drive change while improving reliability, scalability, and cost efficiency.

Core Competencies:

Google Cloud Platform: Python, SQL.

ERP with SAS Business Suite.
