Senior data/security/infrastructure leader with 15+ years of planning, management, and data/infrastructure experience.

As a security director, I define and implement policies for security in vendor management as well as the software and data supply chain. I’m a leader in protection from LLM and AI vulnerabilities, as well as the ever-increasing attack surface of software development. 

As a people manager, I lead transformation through automation as well as the recruitment of talent, which has an outsized impact on the trajectory of the company.

I achieve buy-in for initiatives by building relationships with internal and external stakeholders. I keep managers and staff strategically aligned to maximize impact while providing input on tactical processes. This allows me to drive change while improving reliability, scalability, and cost efficiency.

Core Competencies:

Google Cloud Platform: Lambda architecture, Prisma, Kubernetes and Big Query. Amazon Web Services: Redshift, Athena. Python, R.
